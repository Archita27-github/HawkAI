# Hawk AI: Gesture-Based Food Ordering System
This repository hosts Hawk AI, a cutting-edge food ordering system that leverages AI, machine learning, and deep learning to recognize hand gestures, streamlining the ordering process in restaurants. The web application is fully developed with a user-friendly interface and efficient ordering logic.

## Symbolism and Name
The name Hawk AI and its logo symbolize a hawk gathering its food by keenly observing the actions of other creatures. Similarly, Hawk AI uses a camera to observe human hand gestures, allowing users to select their desired food items. The "AI" in Hawk AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, reflecting the advanced human-computer interaction technology integrated into the system.

## Current Status
The web application currently includes the complete frontend and backend implementation using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, PostgreSQL, and Express, all built on a RESTful API architecture. The next phase involves integrating gesture recognition and interaction through a device camera.

## Future Integration
While the current version demonstrates the web interface's full functionality, future updates will incorporate gesture-based selection and interaction. Once the human-computer interaction logic is implemented, the camera will replace placeholder images of human figures in the interface.

## Interface Snapshots
Below are snapshots of the food ordering application, showcasing its interactive and appealing user interface. These snapshots provide a visual representation of how the system will function, with placeholders indicating where the camera feed will be integrated.
